# JMS RSS FEED

It is a WordPress plugin which is also tracked in WordPress svn repository.

## Why am I Using Github

WordPress is using svn to manage and release their plugins. All plugins must be under control in SVN. However, WordPress doesn't allow to arbitrarily submit changes. All commitment will be released automatically. Therefore, github will be a good place to track all changes before final release.
